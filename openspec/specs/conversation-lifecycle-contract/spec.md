# conversation-lifecycle-contract Specification

## Purpose

Define a unified conversation lifecycle contract across Claude, Codex, and OpenCode, so delete/recovery/order behavior is restart-verifiable and engine-consistent.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Unified Cross-Engine Conversation Lifecycle Contract
The system MUST define consistent lifecycle semantics (delete, recent ordering, restart visibility, key tool card recoverability) across Claude, Codex, and OpenCode.

#### Scenario: lifecycle contract applies to all engines
- **WHEN** the system executes lifecycle-related conversation operations
- **THEN** semantics MUST remain consistent across all three engines
- **AND** engine-specific differences MUST stay inside internal adapter layers

#### Scenario: claude sidebar entry is reconciled before lifecycle consumers treat it as active
- **WHEN** 当前引擎为 `Claude`
- **AND** 用户从 recent conversations sidebar 重新激活一条历史会话
- **AND** 该 entry 需要 canonical resolve、existence check 或等价 reconcile
- **THEN** 生命周期消费者 MUST 在读取其 active identity 前先完成该 reconcile
- **AND** 系统 MUST NOT 让 sidebar 显示的 selected entry 与实际打开的 `Claude` native session identity 相互矛盾

#### Scenario: claude load failure cannot settle as a false loaded success
- **WHEN** `Claude` 历史会话在 history load / reopen 过程中失败
- **THEN** 生命周期状态 MUST 进入可解释的 failure 或 reconcile 分支
- **AND** 系统 MUST NOT 继续把该 entry 当作已正常加载的 thread

#### Scenario: key tool card lifecycle parity across engines
- **WHEN** `commandExecution` or `fileChange` cards are produced in any engine session
- **THEN** lifecycle semantics for visibility and recovery MUST be equivalent across engines
- **AND** engine adapter differences MUST NOT leak to user-visible card continuity

#### Scenario: restart replay preserves key tool card continuity
- **WHEN** user restarts the app and reopens the same conversation
- **THEN** previously visible `commandExecution` and `fileChange` cards MUST be replayed from persisted history
- **AND** replayed card semantics MUST match pre-restart behavior

#### Scenario: Claude concurrent realtime session update prefers turn-bound pending lineage
- **WHEN** 当前引擎为 `Claude`
- **AND** 同一 workspace 下存在多个并行 pending 会话
- **AND** lifecycle consumer 收到带有 `sessionId` 的 realtime session update
- **AND** 事件同时携带可验证的 `turnId`
- **THEN** lifecycle consumer MUST 先按 `turnId` 匹配 pending lineage，再决定 canonical rebind
- **AND** 系统 MUST NOT 仅因当前 active tab 指向另一条 Claude 会话而把 update 误绑到错误会话

### Requirement: Delete Semantics Must Be Restart-Verifiable

The system MUST keep user-visible delete results consistent with restart-visible state.

#### Scenario: delete result is restart-verifiable

- **WHEN** user deletes a conversation and receives a success result
- **THEN** current list MUST remove the target conversation
- **AND** after app restart the deleted conversation MUST NOT reappear

### Requirement: Recent Ordering Signals Must Be Reconstructable

The system MUST rely on reconstructable ordering signals for recent conversations rather than process-local caches only.

#### Scenario: ordering remains stable after restart

- **WHEN** the application restarts and reloads recent conversations
- **THEN** ordering MUST match the same deterministic sort rules
- **AND** ordering MUST NOT depend solely on single-process in-memory state

### Requirement: File Reference Click Safety Contract

会话消息中的文件引用点击链路 MUST 满足“可恢复失败”原则，不得导致应用崩溃。

#### Scenario: valid file reference click opens detail flow without interruption

- **WHEN** 用户点击会话消息中的有效文件引用
- **THEN** 系统 MUST 打开文件详情弹窗或等效详情流程
- **AND** 当前会话生命周期状态 MUST 保持连续（不重置、不退出）

#### Scenario: malformed file reference click does not crash app

- **WHEN** 用户点击缺少必要字段的文件引用
- **THEN** 系统 MUST 显示可恢复提示并拒绝执行危险跳转
- **AND** 应用进程 MUST 保持存活且可继续交互

#### Scenario: click handler exception is contained

- **WHEN** 文件引用点击处理链路发生运行时异常
- **THEN** 异常 MUST 被边界捕获并记录
- **AND** 用户界面 MUST 回退到可继续操作状态

### Requirement: Codex History Reopen Must Recover Structured Activity Facts

当 `Codex` 历史会话重新打开时，系统 MUST 从可恢复事实源重建关键结构化活动，不得仅因 `resumeThread` 快照稀疏而丢失已展示内容。

#### Scenario: sparse resume snapshot still recovers key activity

- **WHEN** `Codex` 历史会话的 `resumeThread` 结果只包含消息正文或缺少结构化活动项
- **THEN** 系统 MUST 使用可恢复的历史事实源补建 `reasoning`、`commandExecution`、`fileChange`
- **AND** 用户重新打开同一会话时 MUST 继续看到这些活动事实

#### Scenario: history fallback stays inside codex adapter boundary

- **WHEN** 系统为 `Codex` 启用历史 fallback
- **THEN** 该补偿逻辑 MUST 保持在 Codex adapter / history loader 边界内
- **AND** `Claude` 与 `OpenCode` 的生命周期行为 MUST 保持不变

### Requirement: Codex History Replay Restores Collaboration Parent-Child Links

`Codex` 历史回放 MUST 恢复可用于线程拓扑构建的协作父子关系，保证 reopen 后生命周期语义与实时阶段连续。

#### Scenario: replay reconstructs parent-child relation from collaboration tool facts

- **WHEN** `Codex` 本地历史包含协作调用（例如创建子会话或向子会话发送指令）
- **THEN** 历史回放 MUST 产出可恢复 parent-child 的结构化事实
- **AND** reopen 后线程关系 MUST 支持 root-subtree 聚合，不得丢失已建立 child links

#### Scenario: unified history loader applies reconstructed links before lifecycle consumers read state

- **WHEN** unified history loader 完成 `Codex` 会话 items 恢复
- **THEN** 系统 MUST 在生命周期消费者读取状态前完成 thread links 回填
- **AND** `session activity`、会话列表与其他读取方 MUST 看到一致的线程关系

#### Scenario: codex-specific link restoration does not regress other engines

- **WHEN** 当前引擎为 `Claude` 或 `OpenCode`
- **THEN** 本恢复策略 MUST NOT 改变其既有生命周期行为
- **AND** 既有跨引擎一致性约束 MUST 继续成立

### Requirement: Realtime Optimization Must Preserve Lifecycle Semantics

Any client-side realtime CPU optimization MUST preserve conversation lifecycle semantics and terminal outcomes.

#### Scenario: optimized and baseline paths converge to same lifecycle outcome
- **WHEN** the same ordered event stream is replayed through baseline and optimized paths
- **THEN** both paths MUST converge to the same lifecycle state transitions and terminal state
- **AND** user-visible message continuity MUST remain equivalent

#### Scenario: batching does not leave pseudo-processing residue
- **WHEN** a turn reaches completed or error terminal state under optimized processing
- **THEN** lifecycle state MUST leave processing mode deterministically
- **AND** the thread MUST NOT remain in stuck pseudo-processing state

#### Scenario: duplicate codex assistant aliases converge before terminal settlement
- **WHEN** a Codex realtime turn observes equivalent assistant content through multiple event aliases or fallback ids
- **THEN** lifecycle consumers MUST converge those observations into one completed assistant message
- **AND** terminal settlement MUST NOT leave duplicate assistant bubbles in the conversation state

#### Scenario: claude completed snapshot replay converges with streamed prefix before terminal settlement
- **WHEN** 当前引擎为 `Claude`
- **AND** live assistant message 已经在 processing 中显示过可读正文前缀
- **AND** terminal completed payload 又以 `streamed prefix + full final snapshot` 形式回放同一条 assistant 内容
- **THEN** 生命周期消费者 MUST 在 terminal settlement 前将该 replay 收敛为一条 completed assistant message
- **AND** conversation state MUST NOT 留下重复的 Markdown report、大段列表或等价主体正文块

#### Scenario: completed replay collapse does not require history reconcile changes
- **WHEN** 系统为 `Claude` 处理 completed replay collapse
- **THEN** 该收敛逻辑 MUST 保持在 completed text merge / lifecycle settlement 边界内
- **AND** 系统 MUST NOT 依赖停用、延后或改写 `Claude` history reconcile 才保持单条 assistant bubble 收敛

### Requirement: Foreground Turn MUST Exit Pseudo-Processing When Recovery Progress Stalls

在统一会话生命周期契约下，queue fusion 发起的 continuation 若未真正接续成功，也 MUST 以有界、可恢复的方式离开 pseudo-processing。

#### Scenario: missing continuation evidence after fusion still settles lifecycle

- **WHEN** 前端已为当前线程发起 fusion continuation
- **AND** 生命周期在受限窗口内没有收到新的 continuation 证据或终态事件
- **THEN** 当前线程 MUST 结算为 recoverable degraded / stalled
- **AND** 线程 MUST 重新进入可交互状态

#### Scenario: late terminal settlement clears pending fusion continuation

- **WHEN** 一条处于待确认状态的 fusion continuation 后续收到了 completed、error、runtime-ended 或 recoverable abort
- **THEN** 生命周期 MUST 清理对应的待确认 continuation 状态
- **AND** 线程 MUST 不再残留伪 processing 或假继续生成文案

### Requirement: Cross-Surface Lifecycle State MUST Remain Non-Contradictory

生命周期展示面之间 MUST 避免对同一条 fusion stalled chain 给出互相矛盾的主状态结论。

#### Scenario: fusion stalled thread cannot coexist with unexplained busy continuation copy

- **WHEN** 当前线程的 fusion continuation 仍处于待确认或 stalled 状态
- **THEN** 用户可见文案 MUST 表达“正在切换 / 等待接续 / 已停滞”等待确认语义
- **AND** 系统 MUST NOT 在无 continuation 证据时直接宣称“内容正在继续生成”

### Requirement: Cross-Engine Lifecycle Parity Under Optimization

Realtime optimization MUST NOT introduce engine-specific lifecycle regressions for Codex, Claude, or OpenCode.

#### Scenario: optimization keeps lifecycle parity across engines
- **WHEN** equivalent lifecycle events are processed for Codex, Claude, and OpenCode threads
- **THEN** lifecycle semantics MUST remain consistent with existing engine contracts
- **AND** optimization internals MUST NOT leak engine-specific behavior to users

#### Scenario: rollback path keeps lifecycle contract intact
- **WHEN** optimization modules are partially or fully disabled for rollback
- **THEN** lifecycle handling MUST still satisfy existing conversation lifecycle requirements
- **AND** restart/replay lifecycle continuity MUST remain valid

### Requirement: Claude Prompt-Overflow Recovery Preserves Lifecycle Continuity

Within the unified conversation lifecycle contract, Claude prompt-overflow auto recovery MUST preserve thread/session continuity and produce deterministic terminal outcomes.

#### Scenario: recovery runs in the same claude thread lifecycle
- **WHEN** Claude turn hits prompt overflow and runtime triggers compact-retry
- **THEN** recovery flow SHALL stay bound to the same Claude thread/session lineage
- **AND** user-visible lifecycle progression SHALL remain a single continuous turn flow

#### Scenario: terminal error remains deterministic after recovery attempt
- **WHEN** one-shot compact-retry cannot recover the turn
- **THEN** runtime SHALL emit one deterministic terminal error outcome
- **AND** lifecycle state SHALL NOT remain stuck in pseudo-processing state

### Requirement: Claude Compaction Lifecycle Events Integrate Into Existing Conversation Event Stream

Claude compaction lifecycle MUST be represented in the existing conversation event stream so current frontend lifecycle handlers can consume them directly.

#### Scenario: compacting signal routes through existing lifecycle handlers
- **WHEN** runtime maps Claude compacting signal
- **THEN** the event SHALL be emitted as `thread/compacting`
- **AND** existing thread lifecycle handlers SHALL process it without engine-specific branching in UI surface

#### Scenario: compact boundary signal routes through existing compacted path
- **WHEN** runtime maps Claude compact boundary signal
- **THEN** the event SHALL be emitted as `thread/compacted`
- **AND** existing compacted message append/dedupe logic SHALL continue to apply

### Requirement: Cross-Engine Lifecycle Contract Remains Intact

Adding Claude compact-retry lifecycle semantics MUST NOT regress existing lifecycle behavior for Codex, OpenCode, and Gemini.

#### Scenario: non-claude lifecycle remains unchanged
- **WHEN** runtime handles turns from non-Claude engines
- **THEN** Claude-specific compact-retry and signal mapping SHALL NOT run
- **AND** existing lifecycle contracts for those engines SHALL remain unchanged

### Requirement: Codex Config Reload MUST Preserve Conversation Visibility Continuity
Within conversation lifecycle contract, Codex config reload MUST preserve thread visibility and historical reopen entry points.

#### Scenario: thread list remains visible after successful reload
- **WHEN** user reloads Codex config successfully during active workspace session
- **THEN** existing thread list MUST remain visible to lifecycle consumers
- **AND** system MUST NOT reset conversation visibility to empty state solely due to reload

#### Scenario: historical reopen remains continuous after reload
- **WHEN** user performs external config change and completes client-side reload, then reopens existing Codex thread
- **THEN** historical messages MUST remain recoverable via same reopen flow
- **AND** lifecycle identity continuity MUST remain consistent with pre-reload state

### Requirement: Codex Lifecycle View MUST Be Cross-Source Unified By Default
For a workspace, Codex lifecycle history view MUST present a unified cross-source list by default rather than source-isolated partitions.

#### Scenario: default history list includes sessions from multiple sources
- **WHEN** workspace has Codex sessions created under multiple sources/providers
- **THEN** lifecycle history list MUST include entries across those sources in one unified timeline
- **AND** user MUST NOT need source switch just to make previously existing history visible

#### Scenario: unified list keeps source identity metadata
- **WHEN** lifecycle consumers read unified history entries
- **THEN** each entry MUST preserve source/provider metadata for identification
- **AND** metadata presence MUST NOT change reopen semantics

### Requirement: Codex History Reopen MUST Remain Stable Across Source Context Changes
Changing source context and reloading config MUST NOT break reopen behavior for already visible history entries.

#### Scenario: reopen historical thread after source change and reload
- **WHEN** user switches source externally, triggers client reload, and reopens an older history entry
- **THEN** system MUST recover historical messages for that entry
- **AND** system MUST NOT report false not-found solely due to current active source mismatch

### Requirement: Codex Config Reload MUST Keep Cross-Engine Lifecycle Parity
Adding Codex config reload and unified history capability MUST NOT regress lifecycle semantics of Claude and Gemini.

#### Scenario: claude lifecycle behavior remains unchanged
- **WHEN** Claude sessions continue after Codex reload/unified-history capability is introduced
- **THEN** Claude lifecycle semantics for reopen, ordering, and continuity MUST remain unchanged
- **AND** Codex-specific logic MUST stay isolated from Claude adapter path

#### Scenario: gemini lifecycle behavior remains unchanged
- **WHEN** Gemini sessions continue after Codex reload/unified-history capability is introduced
- **THEN** Gemini lifecycle semantics for reopen and visibility MUST remain unchanged
- **AND** Codex-specific logic MUST stay isolated from Gemini adapter path

### Requirement: Codex Thread Listing MUST Recover From Workspace Connectivity Drift
During conversation list lifecycle, transient `workspace not connected` and equivalent workspace-connectivity failures MUST be recoverable without dropping visible history continuity or triggering an unbounded recovery storm.

#### Scenario: thread list retries once after workspace reconnect
- **WHEN** Codex `thread/list` fails with `workspace not connected`
- **THEN** client MUST trigger workspace reconnect before surfacing failure
- **AND** client MUST retry the same list request once after reconnect succeeds

#### Scenario: reconnect failure keeps existing list state recoverable
- **WHEN** reconnect attempt still fails
- **THEN** system MUST keep previously loaded thread list state available to user
- **AND** lifecycle flow MUST remain interactive without forcing full session reset

#### Scenario: repeated list recovery failure does not create reconnect storm
- **WHEN** the same workspace repeatedly fails `thread/list` recovery within one bounded recovery window
- **THEN** the system MUST stop unbounded immediate reconnect retries after the configured recovery budget is exhausted
- **AND** the list surface MUST transition to a degraded recoverable state instead of continuing an automatic storm loop

### Requirement: Archive Visibility Semantics Must Be Restart-Verifiable

Within the unified conversation lifecycle contract, archive visibility MUST be a restart-verifiable user-visible fact rather than a process-local filter accident.

#### Scenario: archived conversation disappears from default main list after success

- **WHEN** user archives a conversation and receives success
- **THEN** the current default main conversation surfaces MUST remove that conversation
- **AND** removal MUST be observable without requiring a full app restart

#### Scenario: archived conversation stays hidden after app restart

- **WHEN** user restarts the app after a conversation has been archived
- **THEN** the archived conversation MUST remain hidden from default main conversation surfaces
- **AND** the system MUST NOT reintroduce it solely because history is rebuilt from local files or live thread queries

#### Scenario: unarchived conversation becomes visible again

- **WHEN** user successfully unarchives a conversation
- **THEN** the conversation MUST re-enter the default visible conversation set
- **AND** subsequent list rebuilds MUST treat it as active again

### Requirement: Archive Semantics Must Stay Consistent Across Main Conversation Surfaces

The system MUST apply archive visibility semantics consistently across all default main conversation surfaces.

#### Scenario: sidebar home and topbar agree on archived invisibility

- **WHEN** a conversation is archived
- **THEN** sidebar thread list, workspace home recent conversations, and topbar session-tab recovery set MUST all treat it as hidden by default
- **AND** the user MUST NOT observe one surface keeping the archived conversation visible while another removes it after the same refresh cycle

#### Scenario: archiving one conversation does not interrupt unrelated running sessions

- **WHEN** user archives or deletes a conversation from session management
- **THEN** unrelated running conversations MUST keep their lifecycle and processing state unchanged
- **AND** archive visibility updates MUST NOT be implemented by globally resetting workspace conversation state

### Requirement: Workspace reconnect and restore semantics MUST preserve runtime acquisition boundaries
The system MUST distinguish between restoring workspace/thread UI state and acquiring a managed backend runtime, and it MUST keep repeated runtime acquisition attempts bounded and deterministic for the same workspace-engine pair.

#### Scenario: startup restore keeps thread metadata without forcing runtime spawn
- **WHEN** the client restores active or sidebar-visible workspaces on startup
- **THEN** it MUST restore workspace and thread metadata without automatically spawning a managed runtime for every restored workspace

#### Scenario: runtime-required action triggers managed runtime acquisition
- **WHEN** the user performs a runtime-required action such as send, resume, or new thread on a workspace that does not currently have a managed runtime
- **THEN** the system MUST acquire or reuse a managed runtime for that workspace before execution continues

#### Scenario: reconnect remains idempotent for same workspace-engine pair
- **WHEN** the client issues repeated reconnect or ensure-runtime actions for the same workspace and engine
- **THEN** the system MUST preserve a single effective managed runtime identity for that workspace-engine pair

#### Scenario: repeated acquisition failure enters bounded recoverable state
- **WHEN** managed runtime acquisition keeps failing for the same workspace-engine pair during automatic recovery
- **THEN** the system MUST stop unbounded immediate acquisition attempts after the configured retry budget is exhausted
- **AND** the workspace MUST enter a recoverable degraded or quarantined state until a fresh guarded retry cycle begins

#### Scenario: user-initiated retry restarts guarded acquisition after quarantine
- **WHEN** a workspace-engine pair is already in a degraded or quarantined recovery state and the user explicitly retries a runtime-required action
- **THEN** the system MUST begin a fresh guarded runtime acquisition cycle for that action
- **AND** the new cycle MUST NOT inherit an infinite retry loop from the previously exhausted automatic recovery path

### Requirement: Workspace Restore MUST Canonicalize Active Codex Thread Binding

在统一 conversation lifecycle contract 下，workspace restore / reopen MUST NOT 把已经确认失效的 `Codex` `threadId` 继续当成当前 active binding。

#### Scenario: restore repairs persisted active thread binding before lifecycle use
- **WHEN** workspace restore 已拿到 thread list 或 last-good visible snapshot
- **AND** 当前 persisted `activeThreadId` 已存在已验证的 canonical replacement
- **THEN** 系统 MUST 在后续 lifecycle consumer 使用该 id 前先完成 canonical rebind
- **AND** workspace MUST NOT 以旧 stale `threadId` 进入“看似 restored、实际无法 resume”的状态

#### Scenario: canonical active thread map stays consistent after restore
- **WHEN** 系统发现 `activeThreadIdByWorkspace` 中保存的是已知 stale `threadId`
- **THEN** 系统 MUST 将其收敛为 canonical `threadId` 或显式清空
- **AND** 生命周期读取方 MUST 看到一致的 current active binding

### Requirement: Codex Realtime History Reconcile MUST Be Validation-Oriented

在 `Codex` 会话中，turn completion 后的 history reconcile MUST 以 validation / backfill 为主，而不是 primary duplicate repair。只要客户端已经具备足够的本地 observation 去完成 canonical convergence，系统就 MUST 在 history refresh 之前保持稳定的可见 row 结果。

#### Scenario: equivalent history replay does not change visible row cardinality

- **WHEN** `Codex` turn 已在本地完成 user / assistant / reasoning 的 canonical convergence
- **AND** 后续 history reconcile 只带来等价内容
- **THEN** reconciliation MUST NOT 改变用户可见 message row 数量
- **AND** reconciliation 只 MAY canonicalize ids、metadata 或来源字段

#### Scenario: reconcile may backfill missing structured facts without reintroducing duplicates

- **WHEN** 本地 realtime settlement 缺少部分 canonical metadata 或 structured activity facts
- **AND** post-turn history reconcile 能补齐这些缺失信息
- **THEN** 系统 MAY 用 reconcile 结果回填缺失事实
- **AND** MUST NOT 因回填动作重新引入重复 user / assistant / reasoning rows

#### Scenario: non-codex lifecycle behavior remains unchanged

- **WHEN** 当前引擎为 `Claude`、`Gemini` 或 `OpenCode`
- **THEN** 本 reconciliation 职责调整 MUST NOT 改变其既有生命周期行为
- **AND** engine-specific differences MUST 继续保持在内部 adapter / loader 边界内

### Requirement: Claude Lifecycle Consumers MUST Canonicalize Verified Thread Identity Before State Mutation

在统一 `conversation lifecycle` contract 下，`Claude` 的 lifecycle consumers MUST 在修改 active、loaded、processing、turn-settlement 等 thread-scoped state 之前，先解析已验证的 canonical thread identity。

#### Scenario: approval and request user input continuations use canonical thread identity
- **WHEN** `Claude` lifecycle consumer 处理 approval continue、`requestUserInput` submit、turn completion、turn error 或等价 continuation settlement
- **AND** 当前事件携带的 thread id 已存在已验证 alias 或 pending-to-finalized mapping
- **THEN** consumer MUST 在写入 processing / loaded / active-turn state 前先切换到 canonical thread identity
- **AND** 用户可见生命周期状态 MUST 保持附着在同一条 conversation 上

#### Scenario: selection resume consumes recovered canonical thread identity
- **WHEN** 用户激活某条 `Claude` conversation 并触发异步 resume、history reopen 或 equivalent hydrate
- **AND** resume path 返回的 authoritative thread identity 与初始选中 id 不同
- **THEN** lifecycle state MUST 将 active selection 与 loading ownership 迁移到 recovered canonical thread
- **AND** stale thread MUST NOT 继续被标记为当前 loaded active conversation

### Requirement: Claude Lifecycle MUST Prefer Explicit Reconcile Over False Loaded Success

当 `Claude` 的 canonical identity 在 reopen 或 continue 期间无法被安全确认时，生命周期状态 MUST 进入显式 reconcile / failure，而不是表现为“已成功打开但内容消失”。

#### Scenario: unresolved claude reopen does not settle as empty success
- **WHEN** `Claude` history reopen 或 continuation 期间无法安全确认 canonical thread identity
- **THEN** 生命周期 MUST 进入 explicit reconcile、recoverable failure 或等价分支
- **AND** 系统 MUST NOT 将当前会话 settle 为一个无内容、无说明、但看似已成功加载的状态

### Requirement: Codex History Reconcile MUST Consume Assembled History State

在 `Codex` 会话中，post-turn history reconcile MUST 先经过 shared assembly contract，再暴露给 lifecycle consumers；它只能补 canonical facts / metadata，不能重新承担 primary duplicate repair。

#### Scenario: reconcile hydrates through assembler before lifecycle consumers read state

- **WHEN** `Codex` turn completion 触发 delayed history reconcile
- **THEN** reconcile 返回的 history snapshot MUST 先经过 `ConversationAssembler.hydrateHistory()`
- **AND** lifecycle consumers MUST 读取 assembled state 而不是 raw history items

#### Scenario: reconcile backfills canonical facts without changing converged rows

- **WHEN** 本地 realtime state 已经对 user / assistant / reasoning 完成 semantic convergence
- **AND** reconcile 只补回 canonical id、structured metadata 或缺失 activity facts
- **THEN** conversation lifecycle state MUST 保持相同的 visible row cardinality
- **AND** 系统 MUST NOT 因 reconcile 再次出现重复 assistant、reasoning 或 user rows

### Requirement: Codex Realtime Rendering MUST Preserve Input Responsiveness Without Waiting For History

在 `Codex` 会话中，realtime curtain 的 render scheduling MUST 以本地 render cadence 完成 progressive reveal，并优先保持 composer 输入可操作；系统 MUST NOT 依赖 history reconcile 才恢复最终 Markdown 结构或输入响应。

#### Scenario: active typing may defer live curtain status but input remains responsive

- **WHEN** `Codex` thread 正在 realtime streaming
- **AND** 用户同时在 composer 中继续输入或进行 IME composition
- **THEN** 系统 MAY defer live status、usage 或 snapshot render cadence
- **AND** composer 输入 MUST 继续保持可操作
- **AND** 输入内容、selection、attachment state MUST NOT 因 live curtain 更新被回退或阻塞

#### Scenario: staged markdown reveal converges to final structure before history reconcile

- **WHEN** `Codex` assistant 正在输出长文本或结构化 Markdown 内容
- **THEN** 系统 MAY 使用 staged Markdown throttle 逐步显示结构
- **AND** completion 后的最终 Markdown 结构 MUST 在本地 realtime render 路径中收敛
- **AND** 系统 MUST NOT 依赖 post-turn history reconcile 才让标题、列表或强调结构恢复正确

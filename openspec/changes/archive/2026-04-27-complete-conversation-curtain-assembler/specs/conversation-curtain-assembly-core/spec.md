## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: ConversationAssembler MUST Be The Shared Semantic Assembly Boundary

`ConversationAssembler` MUST serve as the shared semantic assembly boundary for `Codex` realtime observations and history snapshots before conversation-visible state is consumed by lifecycle-aware clients.

#### Scenario: history hydrate is canonicalized before reducer-visible items are read

- **WHEN** a `Codex` history loader returns a snapshot for initial open, reopen, or reconcile refresh
- **THEN** the system MUST assemble that snapshot through `ConversationAssembler.hydrateHistory()`
- **AND** lifecycle consumers MUST read the assembled items rather than raw loader items

#### Scenario: equivalent history replay preserves visible row cardinality

- **WHEN** a `Codex` thread already converged locally for user, assistant, or reasoning rows
- **AND** a later history replay provides only equivalent semantic observations
- **THEN** the assembled history state MUST preserve the same visible row cardinality
- **AND** replay MAY only update canonical ids, metadata, or structured facts

### Requirement: ConversationAssembler MUST Reuse Shared Normalization Semantics

`ConversationAssembler` MUST reuse the shared conversation normalization semantics for user, assistant, and reasoning equivalence rather than maintaining a second comparator policy.

#### Scenario: assembler user equivalence matches curtain normalization

- **WHEN** an optimistic or queued-handoff user bubble is compared with an authoritative history observation
- **THEN** assembler equivalence MUST apply the same wrapper-stripping and canonical comparison semantics as the shared normalization core
- **AND** the system MUST NOT keep duplicate user bubbles because assembler and reducer disagree

#### Scenario: assembler assistant and reasoning equivalence match curtain normalization

- **WHEN** assistant replay or reasoning snapshot observations are assembled from realtime or history sources
- **THEN** assembler equivalence MUST match the shared normalization core for duplicate collapse
- **AND** the system MUST NOT reintroduce duplicate assistant or reasoning rows through assembler-local comparator drift

### Requirement: Normalized Realtime Input MUST Have An Assembly Boundary

Normalized realtime input MUST have a reusable assembly boundary so adapter outputs can be converged without reinterpreting raw engine payload semantics.

#### Scenario: normalized codex event can assemble canonical conversation state

- **WHEN** a `Codex` realtime adapter emits normalized conversation observations
- **THEN** the system MUST provide an assembly path that can converge those observations into canonical conversation items
- **AND** that path MUST remain compatible with the same semantic rules used for history hydrate

#### Scenario: legacy runtime handlers may coexist without changing visible semantics

- **WHEN** part of the runtime still routes normalized events through legacy handlers during migration
- **THEN** visible conversation semantics MUST remain equivalent to the shared assembly contract
- **AND** migration staging MUST NOT change duplicate-collapse or lifecycle outcomes

#### Scenario: normalized realtime assembly path is enabled by default for curtain convergence

- **WHEN** the conversation curtain runtime initializes app settings or feature defaults
- **THEN** normalized realtime assembly MUST be enabled by default for the `Codex` curtain path
- **AND** older persisted settings that still stored the migration flag as disabled MUST be upgraded to the normalized path
- **AND** the system MUST NOT require a hidden experimental toggle to keep realtime/history convergence aligned

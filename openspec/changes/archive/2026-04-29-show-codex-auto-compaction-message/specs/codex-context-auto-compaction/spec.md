## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Codex Compaction Message Surface
Codex context compaction MUST be visible in the conversation message surface when the frontend receives real compaction lifecycle events, regardless of whether compaction was triggered automatically or by the user.

#### Scenario: show compaction start message
- **WHEN** frontend receives `thread/compacting` for a Codex thread
- **THEN** the conversation message surface SHALL show a visible message describing that Codex is compacting background information
- **AND** the thread SHALL continue using the existing compacting state for Composer context indicators

#### Scenario: settle latest compaction message on completion
- **WHEN** frontend receives `thread/compacted` for the same Codex thread
- **AND** the conversation message surface already contains the latest visible Codex compaction start message for that lifecycle
- **THEN** the conversation message surface SHALL update that latest compaction message to a completion message describing that Codex compacted background information
- **AND** duplicate compaction lifecycle events SHALL NOT create duplicate compaction messages for the same thread lifecycle

#### Scenario: append completion fallback when start message is missing
- **WHEN** frontend receives `thread/compacted` for a Codex thread with compaction source flags
- **AND** the conversation message surface does not contain a visible Codex compaction start message for that lifecycle
- **THEN** the conversation message surface SHALL append one completed compaction message for that lifecycle
- **AND** repeated completion events for the same lifecycle SHALL NOT append duplicate fallback messages

#### Scenario: manual compaction uses the same visible message path
- **WHEN** frontend receives `thread/compacting` or `thread/compacted` with `manual: true`
- **THEN** the conversation message surface SHALL show Codex compaction copy without claiming the trigger was automatic
- **AND** existing manual compaction state handling SHALL remain unchanged

#### Scenario: non-codex engines are unaffected
- **WHEN** a non-Codex thread receives compaction lifecycle events
- **THEN** the system SHALL NOT show Codex automatic compaction copy
- **AND** existing engine-specific compaction behavior SHALL remain unchanged

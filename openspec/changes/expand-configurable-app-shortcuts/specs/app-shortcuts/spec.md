## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: App Shortcuts MUST Use A Shared Configurable Contract

Application-level keyboard shortcuts MUST be represented by stable action metadata and persisted settings instead of feature-local hardcoded key checks.

#### Scenario: new app shortcut has complete metadata
- **WHEN** a new application-level shortcut action is added
- **THEN** it MUST define a stable action id
- **AND** it MUST define a persisted setting key
- **AND** it MUST define an i18n label key
- **AND** it MUST define a scope such as `global`, `surface`, `editor`, or `native-menu`
- **AND** it MUST define a default shortcut or an explicit `null` default

#### Scenario: settings renders every configurable app shortcut
- **WHEN** a shortcut action is configurable
- **THEN** Settings -> Shortcuts MUST render it in an appropriate group
- **AND** the user MUST be able to edit or clear the shortcut from that surface

#### Scenario: shortcut display is platform-aware
- **WHEN** Settings displays a shortcut value
- **THEN** the display MUST use the shared platform formatter
- **AND** it MUST NOT hardcode macOS-only labels for non-macOS platforms

### Requirement: App Shortcuts MUST Reuse Shared Parsing And Matching

Application-level shortcut handlers MUST use the shared shortcut parser and platform-aware matcher.

#### Scenario: global handler matches configured shortcut
- **WHEN** a user presses a configured shortcut
- **THEN** the handler MUST evaluate the event through the shared shortcut matcher
- **AND** it MUST respect platform primary modifier mapping

#### Scenario: editable targets are protected
- **WHEN** focus is inside an input, textarea, select, contenteditable surface, or editor textbox
- **THEN** global app shortcuts MUST NOT steal the event unless the action is explicitly editor-scoped

#### Scenario: invalid shortcut values are ignored safely
- **WHEN** a persisted shortcut value cannot be parsed
- **THEN** the handler MUST ignore that shortcut
- **AND** the app MUST continue running without throwing during render or event handling

### Requirement: Open Session Navigation Shortcuts MUST Follow Visible Session Order

The app MUST provide configurable shortcuts for switching to the previous and next open session.

#### Scenario: next open session shortcut advances through open sessions
- **WHEN** multiple open sessions are visible in the session tab order
- **AND** the user presses the configured next open session shortcut
- **THEN** the app MUST activate the next session in that visible order
- **AND** it MUST switch workspace if the target session belongs to another workspace

#### Scenario: previous open session shortcut moves backward through open sessions
- **WHEN** multiple open sessions are visible in the session tab order
- **AND** the user presses the configured previous open session shortcut
- **THEN** the app MUST activate the previous session in that visible order
- **AND** it MUST switch workspace if the target session belongs to another workspace

#### Scenario: session navigation no-ops when unavailable
- **WHEN** there is no active open session
- **OR** there is only one open session
- **THEN** previous/next open session shortcuts MUST no-op
- **AND** they MUST NOT show an error toast

### Requirement: Conversation Sidebar Shortcuts MUST Toggle Layout Visibility

The app MUST provide configurable shortcuts for toggling left and right conversation/sidebar surfaces.

#### Scenario: left sidebar shortcut toggles left conversation surface
- **WHEN** the user presses the configured left sidebar shortcut
- **THEN** the app MUST toggle the left conversation/sidebar surface visibility using existing layout state
- **AND** it MUST NOT create, archive, or switch sessions as a side effect

#### Scenario: right sidebar shortcut toggles right conversation surface
- **WHEN** the user presses the configured right sidebar shortcut
- **THEN** the app MUST toggle the right conversation/sidebar surface visibility using existing layout state
- **AND** it MUST NOT mutate the currently selected file, Git diff, memory tab, or runtime data

#### Scenario: compact layout remains stable
- **WHEN** a sidebar shortcut is pressed in compact or phone layout
- **THEN** the app MUST follow existing responsive layout behavior or no-op safely
- **AND** it MUST NOT leave overlapping incoherent panels visible

### Requirement: Terminal And Runtime Console Shortcuts MUST Remain Separate

Terminal toggle and runtime console toggle MUST be independent configurable actions.

#### Scenario: terminal shortcut toggles terminal panel
- **WHEN** the user presses the configured terminal shortcut
- **THEN** the app MUST toggle the terminal panel
- **AND** it MUST NOT open the runtime console solely because of that shortcut

#### Scenario: runtime console shortcut toggles runtime console
- **WHEN** the user presses the configured runtime console shortcut
- **THEN** the app MUST toggle the runtime console surface
- **AND** it MUST NOT start, stop, restart, or interrupt a runtime solely because of that shortcut

#### Scenario: disabled runtime console shortcut no-ops
- **WHEN** the runtime console shortcut setting is `null`
- **THEN** pressing the suggested default key combination MUST NOT toggle the runtime console

### Requirement: Files Surface Shortcut MUST Not Steal Editor Scoped Shortcuts

The app MUST provide a configurable files surface shortcut while preserving editor-specific save and find shortcuts.

#### Scenario: files shortcut opens or focuses files surface
- **WHEN** the user presses the configured files surface shortcut outside editable/editor targets
- **THEN** the app MUST open, focus, or toggle the files surface according to the implemented files action
- **AND** the action MUST be documented in Settings -> Shortcuts

#### Scenario: editor save remains editor scoped
- **WHEN** focus is inside the file editor
- **AND** the user presses the configured save file shortcut
- **THEN** the editor save action MUST take precedence over global files shortcuts

#### Scenario: editor find remains editor scoped
- **WHEN** focus is inside the file editor
- **AND** the user presses the configured find in file shortcut
- **THEN** the editor find action MUST take precedence over global files shortcuts

### Requirement: Shortcut Defaults MUST Be Conflict-Audited

Shortcut defaults MUST be audited before implementation and must avoid known high-risk conflicts.

#### Scenario: default shortcut table is reviewed
- **WHEN** implementation assigns or changes a default shortcut
- **THEN** the implementation notes or tests MUST cover collisions with existing app shortcuts
- **AND** they MUST cover editor scoped shortcuts

#### Scenario: high-risk default can be null
- **WHEN** no low-conflict default exists for an action
- **THEN** the action MAY default to `null`
- **AND** Settings MUST still allow the user to configure it manually

#### Scenario: existing custom shortcuts survive upgrade
- **WHEN** a user already has custom shortcut settings
- **THEN** adding new shortcut fields MUST NOT reset existing custom shortcut values
